Swoosher: Electric Scooters! A Group Project for CC202 - Business System Development Tools for the May 2020 Semester. 


### How it worked
Name.com is the domain registrar that allows people to buy any domain of their choice. We purchased our domain from here, our domain of choice being “Swoosher.xyz”. After this our domain then gets pointed to the Cloudflare Domain Name System. Cloudflare is the DNS provider and it is also in charge of handling the SSL(Secure Sockets Layer) certification to ensure a secure connection between host and client, this is a vital step that is being carried out by cloudfare as SSL is very important to have in any modern website. The host in this case is a self-hosted virtual machine called a ‘Droplet’ at Digital Ocean. In the droplet, you can run any light-weight system of your choice. So in our instance “Swoosher.xyz” is running from this VM Cloud. The droplet is running a LAMP Stack. A LAMP basically stands for Linux (Operating System), Apache (Web Server), MySQL (Database), PHP/Python (Scripting).
